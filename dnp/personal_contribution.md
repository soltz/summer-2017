The larger project can divided into three parts: event simulation, background subtraction, and quench factor extraction. My responsibility was to develop a framework to simulate realistic event data for high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions (at RHIC or LHC energies). I began with just using PYTHIA to simulate jet events. These simpler models also provided good preliminary data to test the quench factor extraction on. On top of the PYTHIA jet events, I implemented several background models of increasing sophistication, each of which replicates the true nature of the underlying event background better than the last. The current background model samples particle types from a thermal model of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at freezeout. It samples the particle momenta from a 3-D Boltzmann distribution. These models were first implemented in Python and later moved mostly to C++ for better integration with other parts of the project.
