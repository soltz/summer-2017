Understanding Uncertainties and Biases in Jet Quenching in High-Energy Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions

Jets are the collimated radiation resulting from hard scattering between partons in the initial state of high-energy collisions. In heavy-ion collisions, jets interact with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) before freezeout, providing a probe into the internal structure of the QGP. We aim to understand quantitatively if and how background subtraction biases the data and observables. PYTHIA, a library to simulate jet events without any interaction with the underlying event, was used to simulate a model for a signature with one pure jet (a photon) and one quenched jet, where all quenched particle momenta were reduced by the same fraction. Background for the event was simulated using multiplicity values generated by TRENTO fed into a thermal model from which to sample particle types and a 3-dimensional Boltzmann distribution from which to sample particle momenta. Data from the simulated events was used to train a statistical model, which given some data computes a posterior distribution of the quench factor. The model was tested first on pure jet events and later on full events including the background. Moving forward, this model will allow for a quantitative determination of biases induced by various methods of background subtraction.
